# Crosslink Testnet Guide

Welcome to the Milestone 4 Demo!

To join the Milestone 4 demo network follow these steps:

1. Join the [Zcash global discord](https://discord.gg/CWSCEWvq4C), and we'll be on the stage.
2. Download a [`zebra-crosslink` prebuilt binary](https://github.com/ShieldedLabs/zebra-crosslink/releases/latest) for your architecture. They are named as `zebra-<architecture>` for a headless binary, or `zebra-viz-<architecture>` for a binary with the integrated visualizer gui.
3. Run `zebra-<viz? And architecture>` to start your node and connect to the network.
4. Run `zebra-<viz? And architecture> crosslink-bftid` and post that value to the discord. This is your nodeâ€™s BFT identifier.


We can manually add your node to the roster. Before that your node should still be able to sync and observe the dual-chain progress.
