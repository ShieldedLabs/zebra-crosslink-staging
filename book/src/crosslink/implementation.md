# Crosslink Implementation

## Protocol and Engineering Documentation

As we develop this specific instance, we are also aiming to produce _generic implementation specification_ in two forms:

- The other is a set of lower-level [Crosslink Implementation Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YXalTGoezGH8GS1dknO8aK6eBFRq_Pq8LvDeho1KVZ8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2sfs3jgpkfgx)  that engineers aim to adhere to in our implementation.

## Implementation Approach

The high level roadmap has two main phases: _Prototyping Phase_ and _Productionization Phase_.

Please see the Shielded Labs Crosslink [Roadmap Timeline](https://shieldedlabs.net/roadmap/) for current status, and our [Blogpost](https://shieldedlabs.net/crosslink-roadmap-q1-2025/) for more detailed milestone plans.

During the Prototype Phase we often choose the "simplest" design alternative when faced with choices. Simplicity has multiple axes: easy to explain, easy to implement, easiest implications to understand, etc... We prioritize time to market, then easiness to explain.

We intend to revisit each of these documented decisions, and any new ones we discover, during Milestone 5 where we begin the transition from prototype to production-ready.
