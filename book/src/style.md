# Style Conventions

This book uses the following set of style conventions:

- Newly introduced terms use `_markdown single-underscore format_` which looks like _This_.
- General emphasis uses `*markdown single-star format*` which looks like *This*. Note: both newly introduced terms and general emphasis may render identically, but we never-the-less keep the source formatting distinction to improve editability, and in the future we should determine if we can consistently render them distinctly.
