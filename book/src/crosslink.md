# Crosslink Functionality

This [zebra-crosslink](https://github.com/ShieldedLabs/zebra-crosslink) codebase is an in-progress implementation of the *Crosslink* hybrid Proof-of-Work / Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol described in [Zcash Trailing Finality Layer](https://electric-coin-company.github.io/tfl-book/).

**Warning:** All other chapters from 2 on are *not yet updated* for Crosslink.

## For Users

Presently, this implementation is not suitable for general users. There is no functioning testnet support. There is no guarantee Crosslink will activate on the Zcash network, although every indication we've seen is enthusiastic support from both the userbase and Zcash developer communities, so we expect it will be when the time is right.

## For Developers and Protocol Aficionados

While inspired by the [Zcash Trailing Finality Layer](https://electric-coin-company.github.io/tfl-book/) book, this project relies on a suite of scope, goals, and specifications to achieve a successful safe Mainnet deployment with a priority of quick time-to-market.
